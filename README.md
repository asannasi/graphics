# Graphics Side Project

This project is meant to further my personal self-studying of computer 
graphics. Currently, it parses an object file and displays a static pointcloud.

## How to run

This project uses openGL 3.3. It was developed in Visual Studio 2019 with 
the NuGet packages nupengl.core (which includes glew and glfw) and glm.
It was run on a Windows machine, so opengl32.lib was included in the 
dependencies and there is currently no OSX specific function support.

## Resources

I'm following the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) tutorial and 
[this college class](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi20/cse167-a/). 
I tried my best to write my code from scratch with lots of comments
explaining each step to learn as much as possible.
